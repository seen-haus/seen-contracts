/**
 * @title SeenHausNFT
 * @notice This is the Seen.Haus ERC-1155 NFT contract.
 *
 * Key features:
 * - Supports the ERC-2981 NFT Royalty Standard
 * - Tracks the original creator of each token.
 * - Tracks which tokens have a physical part
 * - Logically capped token supplies; a token's supply cannot be increased after minting.
 * - Only ESCROW_AGENT-roled addresses can mint physical NFTs.
 * - Only MINTER-roled addresses can mint digital NFTs, e.g., Seen.Haus staff, approved artists.
 * - Newly minted NFTs are automatically transferred to the MarketController and consigned
